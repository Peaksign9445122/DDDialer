# Instructions
You **must** have Java installed!

Download the JAR file from the "Release" tab and run it through your Java client.

Currently, the main window does not show the number you entered, so there won't be any indication of what you did.

However, if you run this with a console enabled, you will be able to see more info.

This will be fixed in later, more polished versions.
